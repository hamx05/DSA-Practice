# ðŸ“š Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my study and practice work for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), including:

- Implementations of core data structures  
- Solutions to LeetCode problems organized by topic (see `problems/` folder)

### Whatâ€™s inside?

- `data-structures/` â€” Practice code and implementations for fundamental data structures like linked lists, trees, stacks, and more. (detailed breakdown in `data-structures/README.md`).
- `problems/` â€” LeetCode problem solutions organized by category (detailed breakdown in `problems/README.md`).
