# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of algorithms organized by category. The algorithms cover various data structures and techniques, with the exception of the **`ds_lab_final_practice/`** and **`ds_lab_mid_practice/`** folders, which focus on practice for the Data Structures Lab exams.

## Folder Structure

- **`backtracking/`**: Algorithms based on the backtracking technique.
- **`ds_lab_final_practice/`**: Practice material for the Data Structures Lab Final Exam.
- **`ds_lab_mid_practice/`**: Practice material for the Data Structures Lab Midterm Exam.
- **`graphs/`**: Graph algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, shortest path).
- **`hashing/`**: Algorithms using hash tables and hashing techniques.
- **`linked_lists/`**: Algorithms related to linked lists (e.g., traversals, manipulations).
- **`queue/`**: Algorithms involving queue operations.
- **`recursion/`**: Recursive algorithms for various problems.
- **`searching/`**: Searching algorithms (e.g., linear search, binary search).
- **`sorting/`**: Sorting algorithms (e.g., quick sort, merge sort, bubble sort).
- **`stack/`**: Algorithms based on stack data structures.
- **`trees/`**: Tree-related algorithms (e.g., binary trees, tree traversals).
