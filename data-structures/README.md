# ðŸ“š Data Structures Implementations & Practice

This repository contains my personal practice of algorithms from the 3rd semester (Fall 2024), organized by category. Most of these data structures and algorithms were practiced during that semester, but Iâ€™m continuously adding more material and problems to improve and expand my knowledge.
